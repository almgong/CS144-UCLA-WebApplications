An internet connection is necessary to run our code properly since it depends
on resources like Google Maps, Google Suggest, and Bootstrap CSS stuff.
The Google suggest functionality works correctly if you type one character at
a time. When typing quickly, the first result gets chosen and placed in the 
input text box. This is not ideal but it is the same functionality as the given
tutorial for making the Google suggest dropdown. Thus we have left it this way.
